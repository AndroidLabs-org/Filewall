/**
 * Basic interface for a logging system that can output to one or more targets.
 * Note that in addition to classes that will output these logs in some format,
 * one can also implement this interface over a filter and insert that in the chain,
 * such that no targets further down see certain data, or see manipulated forms of the data.
 * You could, for instance, write a "ToHtmlLoggerNode" that just converted all the log data
 * it received to HTML and sent it along to the next node in the chain, without printing it
 * anywhere.

     * @param tr If an exception was thrown, this can be sent along for the logging facilities
